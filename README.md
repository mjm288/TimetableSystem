# What I Learnt
* File handling in Visual Basic. Implementing a normalised database by reading and writing records to text files.
* Searching algorithms (linear search and binary search) to search for a record being displayed.
* Sorting algorithms (bubble sort and quick sort) to sort the records being displayed.
